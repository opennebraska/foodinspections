Nebraska Food Inspections
=========================

This repository contains the Nebraska Food Inspections project initially created at HO3 ([Hack Omaha III: Hack with a Vengeance](http://www.meetup.com/Open-Nebraska-Meetup/events/149197282/)).

This project uses [data from the Nebraska Department of Agriculture](https://data.opennebraska.io/dataset/state-restaurant-inspections) regarding food inspections in 2013. Since starting it, we discovered that the data isn't terribly awesome and this project is still only alive because we haven't finished our rewrite.

We're working with the [Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department](http://lincoln.ne.gov/city/health/) to build a much more useful project. We will be getting better data that is updated far more frequently and, at least initially, will refocus from Nebraska-wide to Lancaster-specific data.

Getting Started
